#crypto-the-app
An application (i developped for my master degree synthese (Applied Mathematic)). That implement different classical cryptosystem.
 And RSA as an asymetric (public key) cryptosytem. And AES as a symetric cryptosystem.
 With all the mathematics tools. and all what needed in different steps. In different tools. 
For examploe the Galois field calculus and all different operations. 
It can be just a great app for education. (with some more documentation to add for it at the app level it can become more and more interesting. ))
